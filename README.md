Machine Learning Prediction Algorithm based on transaction volume

ML Prediction algorithm forecasting based on TX Volume
Simple and straightforward way to confirm trend(Short term).
When prices fluctuate on little volume, itâ€™s not a strong signal. But when a rise or drop occurs on larger volume, it shows that something in the currency has fundamentally changed.
